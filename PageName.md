# Introduction #

This development is an extension of my work to port the Norad SGP4 and SDP4 satellite prediction algorithms to Java which can be found in the [predict4java](http://code.google.com/p/predict4java) project, which is also hosted on Google Code.

I am also developing an Android satellite prediction programme on behalf of AMSAT-UK, which has the name AMSATrac, the source-code for which, can be found [here](http://code.google.com/p/amsatrac) on Google Code.

To a large extent, these projects are a learning platform for me so that I can get experience of the various Google development and run-time tools.
